# CYK Chart Parser
The CYK algorithm works with context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Production rules are either of the form:
```
A -> B C
A -> a
```
where A, B and C are nonterminals and a is a terminal.
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYK_algorithm for an explanation of the algorithm.

Below is a simple toy grammar:
```
S -> NP VP
NP -> DET N
NP -> NP PP
PP -> P NP
VP -> V NP
VP -> VP PP
DET -> the
NP -> I
N -> man
N -> telescope
P -> with
V -> saw
N -> cat
N -> dog
N -> pig
N -> hill
N -> park
N -> roof
P -> from
P -> on
P -> in
```
The language generated by this grammar contains a.o. "I saw the man with the telescope". 

## Usage
```
var CYK = require('./CYK');
var Grammar = require('./ContextFreeGrammar');

// Load grammar file
Grammar.read_grammar_file(grammar_file_path, function(error) {
      // do something
    });

// Parse sentence
var sentence = 'I saw the man with the telescope';
chart_CYK = CYK.CYK_Chart_Parser(sentence);
```

## Developing
* Separate the lexicon from the grammar.
* Chomsky Normal Form entails rules of the form A -> *empty* as well. Such rules cannot be loaded and I don't know if the parser can handle these.

# Earley Chart Parser
The Earley Chart Parser can parse all context-free languages and uses arbitrary context-free grammars.
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser for more information on the algorithm.

## Usage
The Earley parser takes a tagged sentence as argument. Example of a tagged sentence:
```
[{'I', 'Pronoun'}, {'saw', 'Verb'}, {'the', 'Article'}, {'man', 'Noun'}]
```

And here is how to parse a sentence:
```
var EarleyChartParser = require('./EarleyChartParser');
var pos = require('pos');
chart = EarleyChartParser.earley_parse(taggedWords);
```
The resulting chart is an array of length N+1, and each entry contains items of the form [production rule, dot, from]. The dot is the position in the right hand side of the rules up to which it has been recognised. The from is the origin position pointing at the position in the sentence at which recognition of this rule began.
