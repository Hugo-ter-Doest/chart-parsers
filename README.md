# Introduction
This is a library of chart parsers for natural language processing containing the following flavours of chart parsing:
* Cocke Younger Kasama (CYK) Parser: an efficient purely bottom up chart parser for parsing with grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)
* Earley Parser:  a basic chart parser based on Earley's algorithm for parsing with context-free grammars
* Left-Corner Parser: a chart parser for parsing with top-down predictions based on the left-corner of production rules.
* Head-Corner Parser: a chart parser for parsing with top-down predictions based on the head of production rules.

All four parsers are created and called in the same way and return the same type of result, that is a chart with recognised items. In the next section it will be explained how grammars and parsers are used in general. After that each parser will be discussed in more detail.

#Usage
All four parser are used in the same way: load a grammar, create a parser and parse sentences.
```
var GrammarParser = require('GrammarParser');
//var Parser = require('../lib/CYK_Parser');
//var Parser = require('../lib/EarleyParser');
var Parser = require('../lib/LeftCornerParser');
//var Parser = require('../lib/HeadCornerParser');
var tagged_sentence = [['I', 'NP'],
                       ['saw', 'V'],
                       ['the', 'DET'],
                       ['man', 'N'],
                       ['with', 'P'],
                       ['the', 'DET'],
                       ['telescope', 'N']];
var grammar_text = "S -> NP *VP*\nNP -> DET *N*\nNP -> *NP* PP\nPP -> P *NP*\nVP -> *V* NP\nVP -> *VP* PP";

// parse the grammar
var grammar = GrammarParser.parse(grammar_text);
// create parser
var parser = new Parser(grammar);
// parse the sentence
var chart = parser.parse(tagged_sentence);
```

# Context-Free Grammars
The grammar module reads context-free grammars from file, and offers some methods that are practical for parsing.

The syntax of production rules is as follows (in EBNF):
```
grammar =         { comment | production_rule }
production_rule = nonterminal, [ white_space ], "->", [ white_space ], [nonterminal_seq] , ["*" nonterminal "*" nonterminal_seq ]
nonterminal_seq = nonterminal, { whitespace, nonterminal }
nonterminal =     non_whitespace_char, { non_whitespace_char }
comment =         "//", { any_character }
```
Note the possibility of identifying one nonterminal as the head of the production rule. This information is used by the head-corner parser for predicting new partial parses.
Terminals are not allowed in the grammar, because we assume these to be recognised by a lexer and tagged with (lexical) categories. In the grammar these lexical categories can be seen as preterminals.
The grammar parsers also allows adding constraints to the production rules. This has been added for future extension of the parsers to unification-based parsing. Contraints may have two possible forms:
```
<nonterminal1 feature1 feature2> = atom
<nonterminal2 feature3 feature3> = <nonterminal3 feature4>
```
# CYK Chart Parser
The CYK algorithm works with context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Production rules are of the form:
```
A -> B C
A -> a
```
where A, B and C are nonterminals and a is a terminal.

The CYK algorithm is as follows:
```
let the input be a string S consisting of n characters: a1 ... an.
let the grammar contain r nonterminal symbols R1 ... Rr.
This grammar contains the subset Rs which is the set of start symbols.
let P[n,n,r] be an array of booleans. Initialize all elements of P to false.
for each i = 1 to n
  for each unit production Rj -> ai
    set P[i,1,j] = true
  end
end
for each i = 2 to n -- Length of span
  for each j = 1 to n-i+1 -- Start of span
    for each k = 1 to i-1 -- Partition of span
      for each production RA -> RB RC
        if P[j,k,B] and P[j+k,i-k,C] then set P[j,i,A] = true
      end
    end
end
if any of P[1,n,x] is true (x is iterated over the set s, where s are all the indices for Rs) then
  S is member of language
else
  S is not member of language
end
```

Below is a simple toy grammar that is in CNF:
```
S -> NP VP
NP -> DET N
NP -> NP PP
PP -> P NP
VP -> V NP
VP -> VP PP
DET -> the
NP -> I
N -> man
N -> telescope
P -> with
V -> saw
N -> cat
N -> dog
N -> pig
N -> hill
N -> park
N -> roof
P -> from
P -> on
P -> in
```
The language generated by this grammar contains a.o. "I saw the man with the telescope". Clearly, this grammar contains the lexicon as well. In our parser the lexicon is separated from the grammar. The parser expects a tokenized and tagged sentence as input. In this way we feed the output of a tagger into the parser.

## Usage
```
var CYK = require('./CYK');
var Grammar = require('./CFG');

// Read a grammar from file
var grammar = new Grammar(grammar_file_path);

// Create a parser
var parser = new CYK(grammar);

// Declare a tagged sentence. Format is adopted from the Brill part-of-speech tagger at https://github.com/neopunisher/pos-js.
var tagged_sentence = [['I', 'NP'],
                       ['saw', 'V'],
                       ['the', 'DET'],
                       ['man', 'N'],
                       ['with', 'P'],
                       ['the', 'DET'],
                       ['telescope', 'N']];

// Parse a sentence
var chart = parser.parse(tagged_sentence);
```

# Earley Chart Parser
The Earley Chart Parser can parse all context-free languages and uses arbitrary context-free grammars.

The algorithm in pseudo code:
```
function EARLEY-PARSE(words, grammar)
    ENQUEUE((γ → •S, 0), chart[0])
    for i ← from 0 to LENGTH(words) do
        for each state in chart[i] do
            if INCOMPLETE?(state) then
                if NEXT-CAT(state) is a nonterminal then
                    PREDICTOR(state, i, grammar)         // non-terminal
                else do
                    SCANNER(state, i)                    // terminal
            else do
                COMPLETER(state, i)
        end
    end
    return chart
end
 
procedure PREDICTOR((A → α•B, i), j, grammar)
    for each (B → γ) in GRAMMAR-RULES-FOR(B, grammar) do
        ADD-TO-SET((B → •γ, j), chart[j])
    end
end
 
procedure SCANNER((A → α•B, i), j)
    if B ⊂ PARTS-OF-SPEECH(word[j]) then
        ADD-TO-SET((B → word[j], j), chart[j + 1])
    end
end
 
procedure COMPLETER((B → γ•, j), k)
    for each (A → α•Bβ, i) in chart[j] do
        ADD-TO-SET((A → αB•β, i), chart[k])
    end
end
```

## Usage
The Earley parser takes a tagged sentence as argument.
```
var GrammarParser = require('GrammarParser');
var Parser = require('EarleyParser');
var tagged_sentence = [['I', 'NP'],
                       ['saw', 'V'],
                       ['the', 'DET'],
                       ['man', 'N'],
                       ['with', 'P'],
                       ['the', 'DET'],
                       ['telescope', 'N']];
var grammar_text = "S -> NP VP\nNP -> DET N\nNP -> NP PP\nPP -> P NP\nVP -> V NP\nVP -> VP PP";

// parse the grammar
var grammar = GrammarParser.parse(grammar_text);
// create parser
var parser = new Parser(grammar);
// parse the sentence
var chart = parser.parse(tagged_sentence);
```
The resulting chart is an array of length N+1, and each entry contains items of the form [rule, dot, from, children] where:
* rule is the production rule; it has two members: lhs for the left-hand-side of the rule, and rhs for the right-hand-side of the rule.
* dot is the position in the right hand side of the rule up to which it has been recognised. 
* from is the origin position pointing at the position in the sentence at which recognition of this rule began.
* children are the completed items that are used to recognise the current item

Based on the children of the completed items the parse(s) of a sentence can be constructed.

# Left-Corner Chart Parser
##Algorithm
The left-corner algorithm is parses the sentence from left to right just like the Earley algorithm. The only difference is in the prediction of new items. The left-corner relation is used to optimise predictions top down. Therefore, the left-corner algorithm is called an bottom-up with top-down filtering.
The left-corner relation is based on the left-corner of production rules. Consider the following production rule
```
S -> NP VP
```
NP is called the left-corner of S, written as <code> S >_lc NP</code>. The transitive reflexive closure, written as <code>>_lc*</code>,  is used for filtering.
```
function LEFT-CORNER-PARSE(sentence)
  chart = INITIALISE-CHART(sentence)
  agenda = INITIALISE-AGENDA(sentence)
  for i = 0 to n do
    for items [A → α•β, i] do
      LC-PREDICTOR(item, chart, grammar)
      COMPLETER(item, chart, grammar)
    end
  end
  return chart
end
```

# Head-Corner Chart Parser
The algorithm of head corner parsing is based on the idea that the right-hand side of a production rule contains a head, a word or constituent that determines the syntactic type of the complete phrase. To make the algorithm work in each production rule the right hand-side must a symbol that is decorated as head, like this:
 ```
NP -> DET *N*
```
This means that N is head-corner of NP, or <code>NP >_hc N</code>. The parser uses these the head-corner relation to predict new partial parses. In fact, it uses the reflexive transitive closure of the head-corner relation to create new goal items and head-corner items. The closure is written as <code>>_hc*</code>

##Algorithm
Head-corner parsing involves a complex administrative bookkeeping. It uses a chart and an agenda. As long as items are available on the agenda, it takes an item from the agenda and tries to combine it with items on the chart. New items are added to the agenda. Algorithm in pseudo-code:
```
function HEAD-CORNER-PARSE(sentence)
  chart = INITIALISE-CHART(sentence)
  agenda = INITIALISE-AGENDA(sentence)
  while not IS-EMPTY(agenda) do
    current = GET-ITEM-FROM-AGENDA(agenda)
      if not IS-ON-CHART(current) then
        ADD-TO-CHART(chart, current)
        COMBINE-WITH-CHART(chart, current)
      end
  end
  return chart
end
```
The following types of items are used:
* CYK items are of the form <code>[A, i, j]</code> which means that nonterminal A can produce the sentence from position i to position j.
* Goal items are of the form <code>[l, r, A]</code> which means that the nonterminal is expected to be recognised somewhere between position l and r.
* Head-corner items are of the form <code>[S -> NP VP, i, j, l, r] </code> where the right hand side of the production rule has been recognised from position i to j, and the recognised part of the production can generate the sentence from position l to r.

Given a sentence a1, a2, .. , an, the following set is used to initialise the agenda; it adds goal items to the agenda for the start symbol.
```
D_init_agenda = {[i, j, S]|0 <= i <= j <= n}
```
The following set is used to initialise the chart; for each word of the sentence appropriate CYK items are added to the chart.
```
D_init_chart = {[A, i, i+1]| A -> a_i, 0 <= i <= n}
```
These deduction rules are used for creating new items in the combine step:
```
(1) D_HC = {[i, j, A], [X, i, j] |- [B -> α•X•β, i, j] | A >_hc* B}
(2) D_HC_epsilon = {[j, j, A] |- [B -> ••, j, j] | A >_hc* B}
(3) D_left_predict = {[l, r, A], [B -> αC•β•γ, k, r] |- [i, j, C] | A >_hc* B, l <= i <= j <= k}
(4) D_right_predict = {[l, r, A], [B -> α•β•Cγ, l, i] |- [j, k, C] | A >_hc* B, i <= j <= k <= r}
(5) D_pre_complete = {[A -> •β•, i, j] |- [A, i, j]}
(6) D_left_complete = {[i, k, A], [X, i, j], [B -> αX•β•γ, j, k] |- [B -> α•Xβ•γ, i, k] | A >_hc* B}
(7) D_right_complete = {[i, k, A], [B -> α•β•Xγ, i, j], [X, j, k] |- [B -> α•βX•γ, i, k] | A >_hc* B}
```
Deduction rules (1) and (2) introduce head-corner items from goal items. Rules (3) and (4) introduce goal items from partially recognised head-corner items. Rule (5) creates CYK items for head-corner items that are completely recognised. Rules (6) and (7) recognise parts of head-corner items based on CYK items. 

## Usage
The head-corner parser is created and applied as usual; there is however one difference: the production rules of the grammar must be decorated with heads as follows:
```
S -> NP *VP*
NP -> DET *N*
NP -> *NP* PP
PP -> P *NP*
VP -> *V* NP
VP -> *VP* PP
```
