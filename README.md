# CYK Chart Parser
The CYK algorithm works with context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Production rules are either of the form:
```
A -> B C
A -> a
```
where A, B and C are nonterminals and a is a terminal.

Below is a simple toy grammar:
```
S -> NP VP
NP -> DET N
NP -> NP PP
PP -> P NP
VP -> V NP
VP -> VP PP
DET -> the
NP -> I
N -> man
N -> telescope
P -> with
V -> saw
N -> cat
N -> dog
N -> pig
N -> hill
N -> park
N -> roof
P -> from
P -> on
P -> in
```
The language generated by this grammar contains a.o. "I saw the man with the telescope". 

## Usage
```
var CYK = require('./CYK');
var Grammar = require('./ContextFreeGrammar');

// Load grammar file
Grammar.read_grammar_file(grammar_file_path, function(error) {
      // do something
    });

// Parse sentence
var sentence = 'I saw the man with the telescope';
chart_CYK = CYK.CYK_Chart_Parser(sentence);
```

## Developing
* Separate the lexicon from the grammar.
* Chomsky Normal Form entails rules of the form A -> *empty* as well. Such rules cannot be loaded and I don't know if the parser can handle these.
